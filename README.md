# Compiler for Bus-and-Register Microfluidic Assays

This project introduces an extensible bus-and-register microfluidic architecture and delivers an end-to-end compiler that maps structured assay specifications to executable valve schedules on the platform. The tooling pairs automated schedule synthesis with a lightweight physics-in-the-loop verifier so researchers can validate feasibility while characterizing the architecture's scope.
