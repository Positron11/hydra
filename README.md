# Physics-Aware Synthesis and Impossibility Conditions for Mapping Assay Graphs onto Valve-Grid Lab-on-Chips with Periphery I/O

This project develops an end-to-end toolchain for mapping assay sequencing graphs onto valve-grid microfluidic lab-on-chips that constrain inlets/outlets to the chip periphery. The framework unifies synthesis, physics-aware simulation, and formal impossibility certificates so researchers can both realize feasible mappings and understand when single-layer grids fundamentally cannot host a given assay without vertical vias.
